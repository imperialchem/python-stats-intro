    "# Part 3 - ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will move beyond comparing two groups, and explore methods to compare *more than two groups* using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). ANOVA helps us understand if there are significant differences between the means of multiple groups. Specifically, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the purpose of ANOVA and its assumptions\n",
    "* Visualize data across multiple groups\n",
    "* Perform two-way ANOVA using Python to compare penguin body mass across species and sexes\n",
    "* Interpret ANOVA results and checking post-hoc comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "[ANOVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance), or Analysis of Variance, is a statistical method used to test if there are statistically significant differences between the means of two or more groups. For example, we could use ANOVA to test whether there are differences in body mass between different penguin species and different sexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypotheses in ANOVA are, in general:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Null Hypothesis (H₀): All group means are equal (no significant difference between the groups).\n",
    "* Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): At least one group mean is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA itself will not reveal *which* groups are different from each other. To elucidate that, there are different methods, and we will look at one of them, called the [Tukey's HSD (honestly significant difference)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukey%27s_range_test) test, which does pairwise comparisons for all the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key assumptions of ANOVA**:\n",
    "1. Independence: Each entry in the dataset should be independent from the others.\n",
    "2. Normality: The data within each group should follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "3. Homogeneity of variances: The variance within each group should be similar (homoscedasticity).\n",
    "\n",
    "When these assumptions are met, ANOVA is a powerful tool for analyzing group differences. If the assumptions are violated, alternative tests like the [Kruskal-Wallis test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal–Wallis_test) (which is an extension of the Mann-Whitney U test used in part 1) can be used."

However, as in part 1, also here visual proof is not enough to say if there actually is a difference in body mass between the species and sexes. We again need to now perform formal statistical analysis on the data.\n",

    "### ANOVA - data assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA has the same data assumptions as the t-test. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Independence of Observations: The data points in each group must be independent of each other.\n",
    "2. Normality: The data in each group should be approximately normally distributed, which is especially important for small sample sizes. This can be checked using normality tests (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test) or visually with Q-Q plots.\n",
    "3. Homogeneity of Variances: The variances in all the groups should be roughly equal. This can be assessed using tests such as Levene’s test.\n",
    "\n",
    "If assumptions 2 or 3 are not met, you should use a non-parametric test, such as the [Kruskall-Wallis test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal–Wallis_test).\n",
    "\n",
    "If assumption 1 is not met, you can use the [Friedmann test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman_test) or use a [mixed-effects model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_model).\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the t-test, ANOVA is preffered over non-parametric alternatives if the assumptions are met, as it provides a more efficient and reliable way to detect differences between groups.\n",

    "### Performing ANOVA\n",
    "\n",

    "* H₀ (for species): The mean body mass is the same for all species.\n",
    "* H₀ (for sex): The mean body mass is the same for both sexes.\n",
    "* H₀ (interaction): There is no interaction effect between species and sex on body mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative hypotheses are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* H₁ (for species): The mean body mass is different for at least two of the species.\n",
    "* H₁ (for sex): The mean body mass is different for the two of the sexes.\n",
    "* H₁ (interaction): There is an interaction effect between species and sex on body mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask: What are these interaction effects?\n",
    "\n",
    "In ANOVA, interaction effects refer to the scenario where the effect of one independent variable (in this case penguin species) on the dependent variable (body mass) depends on the level of another independent variable (sex). Interaction effects help us understand whether two or more factors (independent variables) work together in a way that impacts the outcome differently than what would be expected from their individual effects alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case:\n",
    "* The main effect of species would show whether different species of penguins have significantly different body masses.\n",
    "* The main effect of sex would show whether male and female penguins have different body masses across all species.\n",
    "* The interaction effect between species and sex would test whether the difference in body mass between males and females changes depending on the species.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no interaction, this means that the difference between, say, male and female penguins’ body mass is the same across all species. In this case, the main effects tell the full story.\n",
    "If there is an interaction effect, this means that the difference between male and female penguins’ body mass depends on the species. For example, the difference in body mass between male and female Gentoo penguins might be larger than between male and female Adelie penguins."
